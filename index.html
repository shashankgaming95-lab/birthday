        <h1>You Cracked It! 🗝️</h1>
        <p>After all the codes and challenges, you reached the final secret. This entire journey was a symbol of my effort and dedication to you.</p>

        <div class="message-block">
            <p id="final-message">
                **The Code to the Heart**
                
                The journey ends where all true journeys start,
                With two keys cracked and logic played by heart.
                The first was love, the second, memory's shine,
                A date when our two futures intertwined.
                
                Though **Shawori** left us on the 128th sun,
                And the digital pet game was undone,
                We built a world of laughter in that short space,
                A foundation deeper than time or place.
                
                You are the puzzle I adore, the beautiful blend:
                A compass for a struggling, distant friend,
                A mind that guides through others' darkest night,
                Yet holds the purest, most chaotic light.
                
                That precious knowledge, that handling of the fray,
                Is why I look to where you lead the way.
                This gift, this code, this effort I have shown,
                Is simply leading you back to your own home.
                
                Happy Birthday, my brilliant love. You are the only person I want to embark on our next adventure with.
            </p>
